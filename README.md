# Membrane Primary Mirrors for Telescopes
By: Stefen Gill

The inflatable membrane mirror is an interest common to both amateur astronomers searching for inexpensive, easily-manufactured optics and research groups looking to build the next great space telescope. The concept seems simple: differential pressure is applied across a thin, reflective material, which then deforms to approximate a paraboloid. I used Jupyter Notebooks to consider the feasibility of a membrane primary mirror suited to an amateur astronomer. I have found such a mirror unrealistic unless special modifications to the mirror or telescope aperture are made. You can use the links below to view the work.

* [hermida-verification.ipynb](https://github.com/smgill/Membrane-Parabolic-Mirror/blob/master/code/hermida-verification.ipynb): I explore a suitable theory to describe membrane deflection under pressure and compare its predictions to the experimental results of a similar project.
* [6-in-f8-feasibility.ipynb](https://github.com/smgill/Membrane-Parabolic-Mirror/blob/master/code/6-in-f8-feasibility.ipynb): I predict the shape of a 6-inch diameter, f/8 membrane mirror and discover that its approximation of a paraboloid is too poor to be an acceptable telescope mirror--even for an amateur astronomer.
